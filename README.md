## Notes

This is still in development. There may be times when it doesn't work, because of OpenAI's overloads. I made this at 4 am, so I might not have the best error handlings, but I'll be fixing all that within the next few days.

You can choose to either do everything locally, or just use a premade template document I have, and make a copy of that.

**Skip to the **[USAGE](#usage)** section if you are using the PREMADE TEMPLATE.**

Template document with ChatGPT integrated: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N7qvw5mZdVe2u2IQ5pnVDmUjHsLEfq9_Z0Tf8PHloZA/edit?usp=sharing

This project is unofficial, and an unofficial ChatGPT api (revChatGPT) is being used for this. Will be updated when OpenAI releases ChatGPT as a full API.

## API 

Follow this guide if you don't want to use my premade template, and want to start a ChatGPT REST API server of your own!

### Without Docker

1. Clone this repo with 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/cesarhuret/docGPT.git
  ```

2. Visit https://chat.openai.com/chat and log in or sign up
  - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
  - Get your OpenAI email and password, and insert them into the `.env` file. 

3. Set up and host the web server: 

  ```
  cd server
  ## Install Requirements
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Run the server
  python server.py
  ```

### Docker Installation

1. Make sure you have docker installed and running

2. Build your docker image

```
cd server

#Build the image
docker build -t chatgpt-api

```

3. Run your docker image

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e email=YOUR_EMAIL_GOES_HERE -e password=YOUR_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE chatgpt-api

```

### Using the REST API

- Send a POST request to https://docgpt.kesarx.repl.co with an application/json body:

```
{
  'message': 'Your questions go here'
}
```
- returns a string: 

```
"here's the response to your question"
```


### In Google Docs

4. Get the URL of the server. Ex: http://localhost:8080/chat

5. Enter your server URL into the Google Docs add-on script. 

6. Google Docs
  - Go to Google Docs and create a new document.
  - Click on Extension > Apps Script
  - Copy the contents of `add-on/ask.js` into the script editor
  - Replace the `SERVER_URL` variable with your server URL
  - Save the script
  - Go back to the Google Doc and refresh the page
  - Click on Extension - `ChatGPT` should be visible under Apps Script
